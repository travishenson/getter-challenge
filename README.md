# Getter Coding Challenge

## Summary
We are working with an app that provides stunt doubles to movies. Movie directors require the ability to be able to quickly view and filter stuntmen for their roles. 

Having done some customer development, the design team have decided that the most appropriate design pattern for this would be a &#39;Tinder-like&#39; swipe card UI.

## Tech Spec
When a card is swiped/dragged right, give the user feedback that the item is &#39;liked&#39; or &#39;selected&#39; and when they swipe left, show that the item/worker is &#39;disliked&#39;. When the card is released/ dropped, the card must move off the screen.

- Creating a data store with an array of ‘workers’ to be displayed in the UI.
- Displaying the stacked cards on the screen.
- Implement a mechanism for dragging and dropping an item.
- Animating or clearing the card from the screen on release of a drag.
- Updating the data layer with the user’s choice.

## Tools Used
- React.js
- HTML/CSS
